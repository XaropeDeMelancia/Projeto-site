Integrated,Orpheus_,0002,Orpheus_0002,,,,"Sorry things've not been going quite so nicely for you, Zagreus. But if you've come to ask me for a song, why, I'm afraid I must stand firm about my answer.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0003,Orpheus_0003,,,,"I'm sorry I've no will for singing, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0004,Orpheus_0004,,,,I feel a bit self-conscious seeing as I must refuse to sing...!,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0005,Orpheus_0005,,,,"I remain your humble court musician, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0006,Orpheus_0006,,,,"I'm truly pleased to see you, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0007,Orpheus_0007,,,,"Would that I could aid you in some way, my friend.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0008,Orpheus_0008,,,,It's awfully quiet whilst you're not around. Still rather quiet now!,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0009,Orpheus_0009,,,,"Nice speaking with you, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0010,Orpheus_0010,,,,"I'm afraid I haven't much to say on this occasion, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0011,Orpheus_0011,,,,"I hope your day or night I guess is going nicely, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0012,Orpheus_0012,,,,"Please do be careful out there, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0013,Orpheus_0013,,,,I wish I could direct you towards a much more lively court musician.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0014,Orpheus_0014,,,,"Normally I'd offer up a song for such occasions, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0015,Orpheus_0015,,,,"Be strong out there, my friend, OK?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0016,Orpheus_0016,,,,"I'm cheering for you all the way, my friend.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0017,Orpheus_0017,,,,"Good luck to you out in that deadly hellscape, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0018,Orpheus_0018,,,,"Thank you for checking up on me, my friend, although I'm quite all right.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0019,Orpheus_0019,,,,"I'm still fresh out of songs or will to sing them, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0020,Orpheus_0020,,,,"I'd ask if you remember what it's like to feel inspired, my friend, but I don't want to know.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0021,Orpheus_0021,,,,"Oh, hello, Zagreus....",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0022,Orpheus_0022,,,,"I thought I'd lost even the gift of music, Zagreus, so, thanks again for helping find that one for me!",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0023,Orpheus_0023,,,,"I must say it's nice having some music in my life again, and hopefully in yours!",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0024,Orpheus_0024,,,,"We all could use a little song from time to time, isn't that so?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0025,Orpheus_0025,,,,It's nice that I no longer have to live and breathe and can be focused purely on my song...!,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0026,Orpheus_0026,,,,"You rescued me from an eternity of not getting to sing, my friend.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0027,Orpheus_0027,,,,"Wishing you a pleasant day or night as ever, my good friend...!",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0028,Orpheus_0028,,,,I'm in the middle of a song my friend...!,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0029,Orpheus_0029,,,,"I'd best get back to singing, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0030,Orpheus_0030,,,,"Let's talk when I'm not singing, Zagreus?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0031,Orpheus_0031,,,,"Hello, my friend, let's get back to my song?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0032,Orpheus_0032,,,,"I'm kind of singing at the moment, Zagreus.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0033,Orpheus_0033,,,,Terribly sorry I can't speak with you right now.,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0034,Orpheus_0034,,,,Perhaps a song would be in order at this time?,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0035,Orpheus_0035,,,,Would you be interested in one of my songs?,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0036,Orpheus_0036,,,,"What might I do for you, my friend?",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0037,Orpheus_0037,,,,Is there a song which you would like to hear?,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0038,Orpheus_0038,,,,"How about a little song, is that all right?",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0039,Orpheus_0039,,,,"I am your humble court musician, Zagreus.",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0040,Orpheus_0040,,,,Things might appear a little brighter with a song...!,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0041,Orpheus_0041,,,,OK I like that one.,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0042,Orpheus_0042,,,,"Why certainly, of course.",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0043,Orpheus_0043,,,,"Why, very well.",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0044,Orpheus_0044,,,,"Good, let's begin, my friend!",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0045,Orpheus_0045,,,,All right I like that one!,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0046,Orpheus_0046,,,,I thought you might say that.,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0047,Orpheus_0047,,,,"Once more, then, I suppose?",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0048,Orpheus_0048,,,,"You like that one, do you?",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0049,Orpheus_0049,,,,I'm happy to oblige you.,,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0050,Orpheus_0050,,,,"Why, I don't see why not!",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0051,Orpheus_0051,,,,"Why this is absolutely splendid, Zagreus, is this really for me? It's absolutely very kind of you to think of me like this.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0052,Orpheus_0052,,,,"Oh, I, certainly, why, I don't see why not, I mean, it's not as though I've got something to do that isn't that...!",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0053,Orpheus_0053,,,,"...And, anyways, I oughtn't have looked back, I mean, the moral of the story is to not look back when you are told not to look back, you understand, don't you, my friend?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0054,Orpheus_0054,,,,"I quite enjoyed our outing, Zagreus, so, I suppose I shall be seeing you around?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0055,Orpheus_0055,,,,"Oh, why, I'm very much obliged that you have thought of me again, for such a wonderfully thoughtful gift, for me?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0056,Orpheus_0056,,,,"You're always much too kind, you know, my friend? Now typically I would express my gratitude through song, except, you understand, don't you?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0057,Orpheus_0057,,,,"Oh, my, but you can't simply be this kind to me without retaliation on my part, my friend! And so, in turn, I have a gift for you!",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0058,Orpheus_0058,,,,"Why, I'm afraid such shows of generosity on your behalf simply demand that I reciprocate in kind, dear Zagreus.",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0059,Orpheus_0059,,,,"I'm very flattered by the gesture, friend! And, seeing as you've once again provided a most gracious gift, I got you something in return!",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0060,Orpheus_0060,,,,Hello...!,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0061,Orpheus_0061,,,,Hello...,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0062,Orpheus_0062,,,,Hmm.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0063,Orpheus_0063,,,,Ah.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0064,Orpheus_0064,,,,"Oh, um, hello.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0065,Orpheus_0065,,,,Hello there.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0066,Orpheus_0066,,,,"Oh hello Zagreus, I was just wondering if you had ever heard of any other court musicians who had lost the will to sing? Your father's asked me to explain myself and honestly it has been rather difficult.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0067,Orpheus_0067,,,,"It's awfully quiet here, you know, when you're out and about? Makes me a bit self-conscious, truth be told, seeing as ostensibly I'm the musician of this court.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0068,Orpheus_0068,,,,"Oh hello Zagreus, you look a little down, and so, I was just wondering, would you perchance fancy a song right now?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0069,Orpheus_0069,,,,"Oh, fancy that one do you. Alas, I've not the heart to sing it anymore. I'm glad you like it though.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0070,Orpheus_0070,,,,"Why, it's that I have lost my muse, my friend. It isn't harder to explain than that. Have you not had such moments in your life, where you had lost the will to chase your passions?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0071,Orpheus_0071,,,,"And I am truly happy for you, friend. Alas, I've had no luck in my own search, not that I'm searching any longer, so, I'll just be over here, OK?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0072,Orpheus_0072,,,,"I fear my muse is long since lost to me, my friend, though truly thanks for asking. I suppose she must be out there somewhere still, since I once traveled 'cross this land in search of her, and found her then. But that was quite a while back.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0073,Orpheus_0073,,,,"Well, this was back when I was still alive, you understand. Your father, why, he doesn't care for anyone to leave this realm, and, basically now I'm stuck here as well! Not seen her since, and, I'm not much for travel anymore.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0074,Orpheus_0074,,,,"I appreciate the sentiment, my friend, though please don't worry about her or me, I mean, we're dead! We're fine.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0075,Orpheus_0075,,,,"Never has there been someone as splendrous as my Eurydice...! She was so gentle, beautiful, and true, that it would make your heart ache just to think on it, and she inspired roughly seven hundred and eleven songs of mine.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0076,Orpheus_0076,,,,"Thank you for listening, my friend. Eurydice, she likewise used to listen to me all the time....",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0077,Orpheus_0077,,,,"I understand you've journeyed well beyond the pits of Tartarus, my friend? Another most heroic feat of yours, and truth be told I find it quite inspiring.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0078,Orpheus_0078,,,,"Oh that's a rather bold insinuation, Zagreus, I don't know that I've the will for that, I... just, I need some time to think, is that all right?",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0079,Orpheus_0079,,,,"My, that is wonderful to hear, my friend! Another in a litany of such heroic deeds, more noble than the heroes of our verse, and even great Achilles over there!",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0080,Orpheus_0080,,,,"Why that is a spectacularly vivid tale, Zagreus, and most deserving to be chronicled in song! Would that there were a poet here still willing to commit such deeds to verse.",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0081,Orpheus_0081,,,,"But that is such a splendid tale, Zagreus, deserving to be sung both far and wide, until it turns into the stuff of myth, as deathless as the gods themselves! I'll gladly tell that one about!",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0082,Orpheus_0082,,,,"But, Zagreus, that is a striking revelation, the connection you describe, I see it, I can see it now! To think the god of wine and you are intricately linked, it isn't obvious, is it?",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0083,Orpheus_0083,,,,"Your tale stirs my soul, it truly does, my friend. It is a marvel to me that such heroism isn't widely known, and I'm committed to the spread of all such truths!",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0084,Orpheus_0084,,,,"Oh, Zagreus, there isn't need for such humility, not when one's deeds of heroism are as great and numerous as yours! It is an honor to have heard such deeds first-hand!",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0085,Orpheus_0085,,,,"Come now, my friend, I know this is a test of faith, of course I am committed to the spread of such heroic deeds as yours! And I do so enjoy getting to hear them first!",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0086,Orpheus_0086,,,,"If I may be so bold, Lord Hades, perhaps the merest sight of me still stirs in you a memory of my incredible performances? It gladdens me you used to like my songs.",,,
To Be Integrated,Orpheus_,0087,Orpheus_0087,,,,"Then very well, my lord. Until next time, I shall continue searching for my muse, probably just in the corner over there.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0088,Orpheus_0088,,,,"I've decided I should give this singing thing another shot for now, my friend. I hope you like it.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0089,Orpheus_0089,,,,"Oh no, I never found my muse, my friend, it's just... seeing you carrying on like this time after time, I was reminded I ought to get on with my life, too, such as it is right now.",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0090,Orpheus_0090,,,,"...You're much too modest, Lord Achilles, for someone with such a number of heroic deeds and glorious decapitations to his name! You ought be more like ever-boastful Zagreus, and talk it up some more!",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0091,Orpheus_0091,,,,Zagreus.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0092,Orpheus_0092,,,,Zagreus?,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0093,Orpheus_0093,,,,Hello my friend.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0094,Orpheus_0094,,,,Hello friend.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0095,Orpheus_0095,,,,Greetings.,,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0096,Orpheus_0096,,,,"...You called upon your humble court musician, as I understand, Lord Hades sir? Referring to myself of course?",,,
Integrated,Orpheus_,0097,Orpheus_0097,,,,"Oh, that. I must apologize, again, Lord Hades sir. For I'm afraid that I've no wish to sing as yet. In spite of your persuasiveness even. And, that, um, is my final word upon the subject. At this time.",,,
Darren,Orpheus_,0098,Orpheus_0098,,,,"If I may be so bold, my lord? Perhaps the merest sight of me still stirs in you a memory of my performances of yore. It gladdens me you used to like my songs.",,,

Greg,Orpheus_,0102,Orpheus_0102,,,,,,,
Greg,Orpheus_,0144,Orpheus_0144,,,,Thank you. I shall...I shall.,,,
Greg,Orpheus_,0214,Orpheus_0214,,,,Of course, my friend.,,,
Greg,Orpheus_,0220,Orpheus_0220,,,,"It's almost everything to me, my friend.",,,
